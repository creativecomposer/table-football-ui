# The table football scores tracker

A Single Page Application to store and display table football scores so the people know who is the champion!

You can start a game, record goals, and view the player statistics.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Dependencies

The back-end service should run in the localhost at port 8080.

Clone the [back-end repo](https://github.com/antony2025/table-football-backend) and run it before starting this app.

## How to run this project

### Note

The below steps are not verified on Windows.

Browsers tested: Google chrome, Firefox

Therefore, it is recommended to use a Linux or Mac system to run this project.

1. Check out the repo.

2. Run `yarn` command to install the dependencies.

3. Run the command `yarn start` to start the development server at port 3000.

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Other available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
